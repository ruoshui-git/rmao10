K08: Cross Pollination and Virtual Insanity
As a team, we investigated "$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero"

What we discovered...
- It creates an isolated environment for your project to live and work in to prevent library and Python version conflicts.
- Created a virtual environment in ~/myherozero (path)
- gets initialized with directories bin, include and lib, as well as the file pyvenv.cfg
- By using a virtual environment, you don't need admin permission to download libraries into your environment.
