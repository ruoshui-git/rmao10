As a team, we looking into other groups' workshops and documented here are our Q/C/C
2020-10-06

Q/C/C:
- Many groups imported random and csv libraries to complete the assignment
- There are many varying lengths of code depending on whether a group utilized DictReader or random.choices
  - Many of the groups with longer code reimplemented what those methods do in their own way.
- Will dictionary comprehension will make the program perform more efficiently?
- Since the percentages don't add up to 100%, will using weights over cum_weights for random.choices make a significant difference?
